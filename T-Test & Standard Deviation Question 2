Performing dependent t-tests manually in R (2)
100 XP

Conducting a dependent t-test, also known as a paired t-test, requires:

    defining your null and alternative hypotheses
    calculating the degrees of freedom
    deciding the significance level (α)
    finding the critical value
    calculating the t-value

The confidence interval is calculated by means of the following formula:

XD¯±tcrit∗sDn√
, where tcrit is the critical t-value.

Test the null hypothesis that the difference in intelligence gain between the post and pre training groups is equal to zero against the alternative hypothesis that there exists a significant difference between both groups at the 95% confidence level. Afterwards compute the confidence interval for the mean of the differences in intelligence gain between groups and Cohen's d.
Instructions

    Start the second part of your hypothesis test by calculating the observed t-value and saving it in the variable t_value. Afterwards compare it to the critical value t_crit you calculated in the previous exercise in order to test your null hypothesis. Finally, check for yourself whether or not the difference in mean between both groups is significant!
    Calculate the confidence interval for the mean of the difference in score. Do not forget to print them out in order to take a look at them.
    Calculate Cohen's d. The formula for Cohen's d is the mean difference divided by standard deviation.
