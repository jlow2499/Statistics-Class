onducting an independent t-test manually (1)
100 XP

In this exercise, you will perform an independent t-test manually in R the same way you reproduced the dependent t-test in the previous chapter. To this purpose, you will test whether or not the null hypothesis holds that the difference in intelligence score gain between the group that trained for 8 days and the group that trained for 19 days is equal to zero. If not, the null can be rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis, which would imply a significance difference in intelligence gain between both training methods. Do this hypothesis test at the 95% confidence level (α=0,05).

Calculation of an independent t-test is similar to calculating a dependent t-test but involves slightly different formulas. The formula for the t-value is
t=XD¯/sE,
where XD¯ is the difference between the two group means and sE is the pooled standard error. The standard error is the sum of standard errors for each group divided by 2. This is equivalent to
(varn1/n1)+(varn2/n2)−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√,
where n1 is the size of the first group and n2 is the size of the second group. The formula for the degrees of freedom is now
n1+n2−2.
Instructions

    The first thing you need is the difference in means of the intelligence gain of both groups. Do this by first saving both means of IQ gains of both groups in the variables mean_t08 and mean_t19. Then use both variables to get the difference in means mean_diff. Subtract the lowest mean from the highest mean!
    Next, calculate the degree of freedom of the t-distribution by using the formula described above. Use both sample sizes in the process and save the result in the variable df.
    Finally, compute the pooled standard error se_pooled. Again, the formula you need is presented in the assignment for your convenience. Use preliminary variables var_t08 and var_t19 in order to get to the pooled standard error. Pay attention to the brackets used in your computations.
